About an hour ago, a person named "sebscripts" (I will refer to the leaker as his username as i do not wanna leak his name) opened a PR
on the Free95 github repository. The PR was actually a leak of Free95 0.2.1 WIP Build + Source, not yet pushed to the repo itself.

Now, where did he get the leak? He was given the source for studying purposes.

The leak wasn't removed because Free95 is open-source, however the build wasn't pushed yet as the code was still messy and needed proper
structuring.

The leak was officially examined & confirmed by me, it has about 2 or 3 NT 4.0 Syscalls.
