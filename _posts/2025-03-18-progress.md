Here's the progress so far...

I've managed to complete the FAT16 driver and Graphics Driver (BGA/Bochs Graphics Adapter for now), i've got user mode working, and now i'm just working on implementing NT syscalls!

So far i've managed to do the NtOpenFile() syscall, it works pretty good. I'm working on implementing more NT syscalls, and it's all NT 4.0 ones by the way.

That's the progress so far, see you next time on the next post!
