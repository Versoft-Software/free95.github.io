I, the author, Kap Petrov, have been assigned the task of **Doing the PS/2 Mouse/Keyboard Driver** and **Implementing Windows API** for
the rewrite of Free95.

I will work mainly on the FAT16 driver, and graphics driver & Win32 API.

Things needed to get working on Windows API:
- User Mode
- An executable loader
- Graphics driver (for GUI applications)
- Syscalls

And i'll do all of these. For the executable loader, i'm gonna implement an ELF one first for testing the Win32 API and such, and
then i'll work on the PE Loader.

Version 0.2.1 will have basic ability of running Winodws GUI Applications and a newly improved codebase.
