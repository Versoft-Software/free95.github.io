I, the author, Kap Petrov, have been assigned the task of **developing the PS/2 mouse/keyboard driver** and **implementing the Windows API** for the Free95 rewrite.  

I will primarily work on the FAT16 driver, graphics driver, and Win32 API.  

### Things needed to get the Windows API working:  
- User mode  
- An executable loader  
- A graphics driver (for GUI applications)  
- Syscalls  

I will handle all of these. For the executable loader, I will first implement an ELF loader to test the Win32 API, and then I will work on the PE loader.  

Version 0.2.1 will introduce basic support for running Windows GUI applications and a newly improved codebase.
