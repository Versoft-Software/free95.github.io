0.3.0 Beta 2 has been released!

It adds the Native Shell in graphical mode!

Also we added a loader for ```.bat``` files, and you can now run the provided executables in the shell!

Beta 2 List of Programs 
- reboot.exe - *reboot Free95*
- stop.exe - *shutdown Free95*
- hello.exe - *prints "Hello, World!"*
- freever.exe - *prints the version, beta number, and build number*
- bsod.exe - *crashes the system*

I'd also like to give you a progress report of the start I've gotten on Beta 3!

As of this post, we are at build 5402.

I added the ```print.h``` library to make it easier to use ```NtDisplayString``` in apps!

There are two new apps:

- blorp.exe - *a test application for the print lib*
- lsbin.exe - *lists all available apps*


Signing off,
