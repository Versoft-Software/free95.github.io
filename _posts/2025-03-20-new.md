Free95 0.3.0 Beta 1 was just released on github, https://github.com/Versoft-Software/Free95/releases/tag/0.3.0-beta1

It includes a proper userspace, with both an ELF and EXE loader (Configurable by changing a define in kernel.c).

Although the EXE Loader is a bit broken while working with strings (eg. NtDisplayString will display random string instead of one given)
and we're actively working to fix it.

There is only 2 NT Syscalls yet:

- NtDisplayString
- NtOpenFile

All of them are NT 4.0, ofcourse. Next beta is estimated to be released in ~3 weeks.
