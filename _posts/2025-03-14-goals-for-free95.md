Free95 is custom OS that is meant to replicate the windows API while still having a different kernel, this project differs from other operating systems such as reactOS which attempts to replicate the NT kernel, but we plan to only replicate the API, with a custom kernel that handles all the stuff the API needs to function.

Version 1.0.0 will be released once we meet these goals (which may a while for a basic implementation of these)
- Working user input (keyboard and mouse)
- Working Windows API implementation
- A simple explorer.exe implementation (explorer.exe handles the DE, and file explorer parts of windows so it should do that here too)
